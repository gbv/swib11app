# REQUIREMENTS (Linux)

First, install a C compiler, git (optional), and cpanminus:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential git-core
    wget -O - http://cpanmin.us | sudo perl - --self-upgrade

Second, install this repository either by git:

    git clone git://github.com/gbv/swib11app.git

or as snapshot zipfile (if you don't have git):
  
    wget http://github.com/gbv/swib11app/zipball/master
    unzip master
    mv gbv-swib11app-* swib11app

Third, install required CPAN modules with cpanminus:

    cd swib11app
    sudo cpanm --installdeps ./app

# REQUIREMENTS (Windows)

First, install Strawberry Perl or Cygwin with Perl and cpanminus.

Second, install this repository either by git from

  git://github.com/gbv/swib11app.git

or as snapshot zipfile from

  http://github.com/gbv/swib11app/zipball/master

Third, start a command line in the 'swib11app' directory
and install required CPAN modules with cpanminus:

    sudo cpanm --installdeps ./app

# TESTING

Just start the application from the application root directory with

    cd app
    plackup -r

It should now be accesible at http://localhost:5000/ and logging output is
sent to the console.

# DEPLOYMENT AT DOTCLOUD

Given a dotCloud account, you can deploy your application as following.
First, create an application

    dotcloud create swib11app

Second, push the application into the cloud

    dotcloud push swib11app

If you work with git, this will only push the latest master revision,
so you may need to do a commit first. The first push will take some time
to install all CPAN modules at dotCloud.

A demo is running live at http://swib11app-nichtich.dotcloud.com/
